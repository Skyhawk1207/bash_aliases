# bash_aliases
A set of bash aliases I like to use for my Debian/Ubuntu installs.

A tiny collection of handy shell shortcutsâ€”copy these into `~/.bash_aliases` and reload your shell.

1. **Save** to `~/.bash_aliases`
2. **Ensure** it's sourced in `~/.bashrc`:

   ```bash
   [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ] && . ~/.bash_aliases
   ```
3. **Reload** your shell:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
